Folder contains following file:

1. chrX.fa: The reference sequence for Chr x in fasta format
            First line is header line followed by the sequence (ignore the newlines)

2. chrX_last_col.txt : The last column of the BWT.
                       This sequence contains one more character than the reference sequence as it also contains
		       the special character $ which is appended to its end
		
3. chrX_map.txt: Contains mapping of indexes in bwt with index in ref.
                 Line number i (0-based) has the starting index in the reference of the ith sorted circular shift
                 eg. First line contains 3435 means that the string starting
                     at 3435 (0-based) is the first in sort order of bwt rotated strings.
                 	
4. reads:  Contains about 3 million reads, one read per line, reads are roughly of length 100, but may not
           be exactly so. Also each read could come from the reference sequence or its reverse complement, so
           consider reverse complements of each read as well.

REVERSE AND COMPLEMENT THE STRINGS AND CHECK THEM TOO

5. Red and Green gene locations: Each of these genes should begin with ATGGCCCAGCAGTGGAGCCTC. You can grep for it and the red and green starting positions should appear at (0-based):

Red exons:
149249757 - 149249868
149256127 - 149256423
149258412 - 149258580
149260048 - 149260213
149261768 - 149262007
149264290 - 149264400

Green exons:
149288166 - 149288277
149293258 - 149293554
149295542 - 149295710
149297178 - 149297343
149298898 - 149299137
149301420 - 149301530

As a test, use the following read:
GAGGACAGCACCCAGTCCAGCATCTTCACCTACACCAACAGCAACTCCACCAGAGGTGAGCCAGCAGGCCCGTGGAGGCTGGGTGGCTGCACTGGGGGCCA
which should match at 149249814.
